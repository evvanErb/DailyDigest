# DailyDigest
Emails users the current weather and top news stories daily

Written in Python 3.x

Uses newsapi.org for top news stories and openweathermap.org for current weather

to run: python3 main.py

TODO:
Allow it to run in background so it does it daily instead of just once
Allow zip code to be tied to user email instead of hard coded
